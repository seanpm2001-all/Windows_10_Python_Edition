## Significance

This was my end of year Python assignment for chapter 5 of my first year of Python classes. It is also my first Python program to utilize 3D graphics, however I did poorly on this. When I originally made this, I only got it to work on [Codeskulptor 3](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/) but no-where else.
This project posed a challenge for me at the time, and I need to do more really challenging work again to train myself better.

## Build-names

For the first 10 builds, the project didn't have an official name yet, besides being a python project for chapter 5 of my Python class.

**This section was last updated on August 10th 2020 (08.10.2020)**

### First 10 builds

Here are the name for the first 10 builds. They are called `Beta` as in 2018, I still thought `Alpha` came after beta. They are also called R1 builds

1. EDHESIVE ASSIGNMENT 5.txt (Also called R1 Build 1, this is the very first version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running)

2. EDHESIVE ASSIGNMENT 5.51 .txt (Also called R1 Build 2, this is the second version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running)

3. EDHESIVE ASSIGNMENT 5.51A.txt (Also called R1 Build 3, this is the third version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running)

4. EDHESIVE ASSIGNMENT 5.51B.txt (Also called R1 Build 4, this is the fourth version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running)

5. EDHESIVE ASSIGNMENT 5.51CA.txt (Also called R1 Build 5, this is the fifth version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running)

6. EDHESIVE ASSIGNMENT 5.53A.txt (Also called R1 Build 6, this is the sixth version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running)

7. EDHESIVE ASSIGNMENT 5.52.txt (Also called R1 Build 7, this is the seventh version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running)

8. EDHESIVE ASSIGNMENT 5.54.txt (Also called R1 Build 8, this is the eighth version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running)

9. corrupt 5.54.txt (Also called R1 Build #$%--*  this is the ninth version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running) it is labeled as "Corrupted" but actually just doesn't run. It is also regarded as build 9C at times, but it is actually 8C (C in this instance stands for corrupt, which in turn means "won't run") I had a build system and I would fall back on other versions. This version is just useless.

10. EDHESIVE ASSIGNMENT 5.55.txt (Also called R1 Build 9, this is the ninth version of the project. It comes in Plain Text (.txt) format, and needs to be converted to Python format (.py) before running)

### R2 builds

R2 builds are the builds of the project that came after submitting the project at the end of the year, where the project got rebuilt, and began to act as a summer project. It was abandoned later on in early June 2018.

Currently, there are 9 R2 builds, after that, the project was abandoned until I started adding it to GitHub. This project has inspired me: I have been doing a lot of easy work lately, and I need to be challenged more, as I don't face challenges as often anymore. This project was a real challenge, as I have very little knowledge on getting graphics to work on Python, and I need to learn how to build an application from the ground up to a professional state on my own.

Here is a list of the R2 builds:

11. Python Project 5 Build 10 (This is the 11th version of the project. All files still need to be converted from TXT to PY (not READMEs, only files with Python syntax)

12. Python Project 5 Build 11 (This is the 12th version of the project. All files still need to be converted from TXT to PY (not READMEs, only files with Python syntax)

13. Python Project 5 Build 12 (This is the 13th version of the project. All files still need to be converted from TXT to PY (not READMEs, only files with Python syntax)

14. Python Project 5 Build 13 (This is the 14th version of the project. All files still need to be converted from TXT to PY (not READMEs, only files with Python syntax)

15. Python Project 5 R2.04 (This is the 15th version of the project, and the first (and last) version to contain a password to open. If you want to open it without cracking the zip file, the password is `winthon204` the description of using `WinRAR` is false, as other compression tool programs work as well, such as `7zip` I have tested, this version cannot be extracted with Windows Explorer (EXPLORER.EXE) this build also has a name without a build number, due to an error when making a new version. all files still need to be converted from TXT to PY (not READMEs, only files with Python syntax))

* Build 15 is missing, it was merged somewhere. This is easy to fix, as everything iss still there.

16. Windows 10 Python Edition Build 15.1 (This is the official name, and the 16th version of the project. This is the first build with the name `Windows 10 Python Edition` all files still need to be converted from TXT to PY (not READMEs, only files with Python syntax))

17. Windows 10 Python Edition Version 16 (This is the official name, and the 17th version of the project. This is the second build with the name `Windows 10 Python Edition` all files still need to be converted from TXT to PY (not READMEs, only files with Python syntax))

18. Windows 10 Python Edition Version 17 (This is the official name, and the 18th version of the project. This is the third build with the name `Windows 10 Python Edition` all files still need to be converted from TXT to PY (not READMEs, only files with Python syntax))

19. Windows 10 Python Edition Version 18 (This is the 19th version of the project, and the last version until the long Hiatus. It is also the largest build, with over 200 megabytes of files, a massive jump from the previous build. All files still need to be converted from TXT to PY (not READMEs, only files with Python syntax))

## Add-ons

Add-ons are directories that are extras for the project that can be copied to the root of the build to get new features. Currently, there are 4 add-ons for this project:

**This section was last updated on August 10th 2020 (08.10.2020)**

### Add-ons for Beta (R1) versions

There are currently 2 add-ons for beta versions. They include:

1. Sorting directory (Contains pre-built directories so you can sort the files for yourself. Also contains 3 pieces of documentation)

2. License pack (Contains GNU GPL3 and Creative Commons ShareALike Attributions 4.0 licenses)

3. No other add-ons for Beta R1 versions at the moment.

**This section was last updated on August 10th 2020 (08.10.2020)**

### Add-ons for Alpha (R2) versions

There are currently 2 add-ons for Alpha versions. They include:

1. Error collection (Contains all 18 of the custom faked Windows error messages for the project)

2. License pack (Contains GNU GPL3 and Creative Commons ShareALike Attributions 4.0 licenses)

3. No other add-ons for Alpha R2 versions at the moment.

## Passwords for builds

I am bringing this up again for if you missed it.

There is 1 build that requires a password to be extracted (Python Project 5 R2.04)

The password is: `winthon204`

## Codeskulptor

I have not gotten this program to work in regular Python yet, but I have gotten it to work on the python 3 Codeskulptor website. You can test it [here](https://py3.codeskulptor.org).

**This section was last updated on August 10th 2020 (08.10.2020)**

## Known issues

There are some known issues with this project. They include:

1. A lot of directories have an unnecessary `(1)` in their name. A duplication error happened a long time ago, and I chose to keep it in so that I could make a complete archive

2. Most of the scripts do not work, some only work with codeskulptor [see above](#Codeskulptor).

3. No other known issues at the moment.

## Other notes

1. Back when I made this, I didn't know that Iot was spelled with an i, I thought it was spelled with an L and I didn't know what it meant.

2. There are several files and directories with (1) in the name. This was an error that made its way into many versions, out of a duplication error

3. The R1 directory contains the first 10 versions of the project, the R2 directory contains later builds

4. Most Python files aren't functional.

5. This project was originally just an end of year Python project, but its purpose was expanded.

6. Once I learned how to upload directories to GitHub, the next day, I applied this skill to this project, and it helped boost development significantly.

7. No other notes at the moment
