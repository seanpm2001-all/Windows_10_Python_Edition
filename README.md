## Significance

This was my end of year Python assignment for chapter 5 of my first year of Python classes. It is also my first Python program to utilize 3D graphics, however I did poorly on this. When I originally made this, I only got it to work on [Codeskulptor 3](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/) but no-where else.
