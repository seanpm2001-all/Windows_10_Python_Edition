Thank you for downloading this extension about sorting beta versions of our program
Windows 10 Python Edition!

and versions can be tricky at times
Please do not redistribute this software without these 3 files in the INFOANDHELP directory:

This package is open-source and can be moved, downloaded, and installed on any

Now get the Beta version files in here, and we have directories (folders) to help
you store them!
